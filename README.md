## Getting Started
### Client & Server

2. Navigate into the corrseponding folder
3. run `go get`
4. run `go run .`

Alternatively use Docker

2. run `docker run -it $(docker build -q .)`

### Sensors (only tested on Linux)
1. Make sure python3 and pip are installed
2. Navigate to corresponding folder
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run `python main.py`

Note: Altough using Docker is possible, webcam access is tricky, we therefore do not include the Dockerfile (see older commits for Dockerfile)
